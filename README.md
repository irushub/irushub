# Hey there! 👋 I'm irus

🚀 Student/Developer by day,  Blockchain enthusiast by night.  💻

## What I Do:
- 🤖 Make Discord bots that are smarter than your average human.
- 🔧 Create browser extensions to make the internet a little less chaotic.
- 🕸️ Designing websites that look great and sometimes even work!
- 🧠 I teach machines to learn. They're getting smarter; I'm just hoping they don't take over.
- 🎨 Build cool and play with NFT stuff—images, metadata, and more!

## Fun Facts:
- Debugging is just my way of having a conversation with the computer. 🤖
- I write code that even my future self struggles to understand. 😅
